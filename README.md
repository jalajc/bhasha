# Bhasha
Bhasha (भाषा) is a repository of algorithmic implementations of language functions specially for non-English Languages. Other Indian language lovers can contribute.
This repository is established to create or improve funtions which facilitates language processing in non-english languages.

`Invite all Indian language lovers to contribute to this repository`

# How can everyone contribute
* Linguists: People who know language grammer can contribute by outlining rules e.g. sound rules for similar sounding words (करता-कर्ता), equivalence (कर्म, करम but not क्रम). Language construct rules-the grammer (व्याकरण). You can contribute to building a words database of any language can contribute a ton to this project.
* Programmers, Computer Science scolars: Bring on implementations to some of known linguistic functions of say # spellcheck # levenshtein distance (, # soundex - Calculate the soundex key of a string, # similar_text - Calculate the similarity between two strings, # metaphone - Calculate the metaphone key of a string). Many a times it could be rather easy to imlement Machine Learning, Bring on that insights where to draw line. The performace 

# Directory Structure
 * First level directory is language directory (e.g. 'Hindi', 'Tamil', 'Telugu')
 * Second level directory: Linguistic rules + Computer Language (e.g 'php', 'python')
 e.g Bhasha->Tamil->Linguistic Rules; Bhasha->Tamil->php

# Programming Language
 * Choice of programming language is open
 
# Acknoledgement and Credits
  * Do provide necessary acknoledgement and credits where ever you have used or taken inspiration from.
# To start with
  I like the work in spanish by Israel J. Sustaita at http://www.ojocaliente.net/spanish_metaphone.php
